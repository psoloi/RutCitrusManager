# RutCitrusManager
## At present, the program is in the test stage, many functions have not been fully developed or even not developed, time is limited. I am still in high school, this project may not be developed for a long time, and my English is not very good, please understand.

This project is a combination of server + client, and there should be a pure client made using Winform in the future.

## Project all warnings
```csharp
ManagementObjectSearcher searcher = new("SELECT * FROM Win32_ComputerSystem");
foreach (ManagementObject mo in searcher.Get())
{
    string? model = mo["Model"] as string;
    if (model != null && (model.Contains("Virtual") || model.Contains("VMware") || model.Contains("Xen") || model.Contains("KVM") || model.Contains("Hyper")))
    {
        isVM = true;
        break;
    }
}
```
